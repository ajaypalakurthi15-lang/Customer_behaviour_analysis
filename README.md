# Customer_behaviour_analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer behaviour analysis using python, sql and power BI
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and presentation.
It showcases skills in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server), Power BI, and Gamma for reporting.

The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, extract actionable insights, and present findings through an interactive dashboard and a professional report.

📁 Dataset

Source: [Specify dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, company data, public API]

Format: CSV / Excel / SQL table

Description: [Briefly describe what the dataset contains — e.g., sales transactions, customer data, etc.]

Size: [e.g., 50,000 rows × 12 columns]

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🔍 Steps / Workflow
1. Data Loading

Loaded dataset using Pandas in Python.

Performed basic checks (shape, column info, missing values).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Identified data patterns, trends, and outliers.

Visualized key insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.

Standardized formats and filtered out irrelevant columns.

4. SQL Analysis

Imported the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Wrote and executed SQL queries to:

Aggregate and filter data

Join multiple tables

Generate summary statistics

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the SQL database.

Created an interactive dashboard showing KPIs, trends, and visual insights.

Published and shared dashboard link.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Summarized findings and insights in a structured Gamma presentation.

Included visuals from Power BI and Python EDA.

📈 Dashboard & Reports

Power BI Dashboard: [Insert Power BI link or screenshot]

Gamma Report / PPT: [Insert Gamma or PDF link]

🚀 Results & Insights

Key finding 1: [Short summary of major insight]

Key finding 2: [Short summary of major insight]

Key finding 3: [Short summary of major insight]

Overall, the analysis helped identify trends, performance gaps, and opportunities for optimization.
